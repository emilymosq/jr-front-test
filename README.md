# 🚦 HTTP Status Checker - Frontend Developer Test 🚦

[🇪🇸 Versión en Español](./README.es.md)

## 👋 Welcome!

Hello and welcome to the HTTP Status Checker Limbip code challenge! ✨ This project is designed to evaluate your React skills, as well as your ability to solve problems and write clean, maintainable code. The challenge is available in both **TypeScript** and **JavaScript** versions. While you can choose either version, TypeScript knowledge will be particularly valuable for your future work with us. 🚀

## 🔍 Project Overview

This application is a simple HTTP Status Code Checker with a traffic light visualization. The user can input an HTTP status code or status name (like "ok" or "not found"), and the app will display:

- 🚦 A traffic light that changes color based on the status (green for success, red for errors)
- 📋 Status information with details about the code category and meaning
- 📱 On mobile devices, an info button that opens a modal with status details

## ✅ Your Tasks

The application has a few bugs and missing features that you need to fix and implement. We've included tests that will help you identify some of the issues. 🐛

### 1. 🔧 Fix the Existing Bugs

There are several bugs in the application that need to be fixed:

- 🧪 **Test Failures**: Run `npm test` to see the failing tests. You need to fix the code to make these tests pass.
- 🖥️ **Desktop Layout**: The app is currently aligned to the left side on desktop view. It should be centered on the screen.
- 📱 **Modal Display**: On mobile view, when clicking the info button, the modal should display the status information, but it currently doesn't show the content correctly.

### 2. ✨ Add New Functionality

Implement the following new features:

- 🔗 **URL Validation and Status Check**:
  - Modify the text input to accept a URL
  - If the input is a valid URL, make a request to that URL and extract the response status code
  - Update the traffic light based on the response (green if reachable, red if an error occurs)
  - In the info modal/card, add a button to open the URL in a new tab if it's reachable

- 📊 **Status Code History with Chart Visualization**:
  - Implement a custom React hook (`useStatusHistory`) to track the history of checked status codes
  - Integrate a charting library (we use [react-charts](https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/)) to display a visual representation of the status code history
  - Add a "History" button that opens a modal showing the chart
  - The chart should display at least the last 10 status codes checked, with different colors for different status categories (2xx, 4xx, 5xx)
